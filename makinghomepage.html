    <h3>Goals:</h3>

    <h3> Identify clearly what sub-pages will go on your website </h3>

    For our subpages, there will be 2 subpages along with the homepage, there will be a subpage for the good and bad examples of photography, and the second page will be the calendar page, it will show all the important events happening during the year so that the members will be able to know the dates so that they can take pictures. The homepage will have the assignments for the students in the yearbook and photography club.

    <h3>Identify and plan consistency into website pages</h3>
    The template will be used for all the websites, so there will be a form of consistency between the subpages and the homepages, it will have the same format throughout the subpages.

    <h3>What message is your website giving out overall?</h3>
    Our main message that we are trying to convey is to give knowledge about when the  yearbook photography team wants their assignments due, and what it requires.

    <h3>Describe your theme.</h3>
    We don't have a named theme (meaning that we didn't aim for a certain theme) but we tried to make the outlook of our website acceptable for both genders as males do not like a website completely filled pink flowers vice versa. We tried to make our theme extremely simple as the client wanted it to be, and he thinks the theme is perfect.

    <h3>What are essential elements to have on each page of your website?</h3>
    The essential elements of each page on our website is probably uniformity,

    <h3>Will your page banner be on each page? If yes, is it in the same place? Is it the same size?</h3>
    For the website, we (Minji) made a very simple logo for the club. This logo is present on the homepage and the subpages in the same location. It is not too big, but big enough to capture the attention of the audience.

    <h3>What font will you use for titles  or headings on your content pages?</h3>
    As of now, the font we are using is the Default Font. We are thinking of changing it in the future but as of now the font is doing its job and the words are clear for the audience.

    <h3>What color will you use for titles or headings on your content pages?</h3>
    The color of the headings will be black

    <h3>What font will you use for descriptions on your content pages?</h3>
    We would like to use font such as arial or times new roman, the most common and simplest font available.

    <h3>What color will you use for descriptions?</h3>
    We will use the color black for description for the website.

    NAVIGATION:
    <h3>Where will you place the navigation bar on the page?</h3>
    We will place the navigation bar on the top of the page, to make it clear simple and accessible.
    <h3>What content will be on the navigation bar?</h3>
    There will the yearbook logo, title and the three subpages. (Assignments, good vs. bad, calender)

    <h3>How will your navigation bar help visitors know which page they are on?</h3>
    The audience which is the students in yearbook club will see clearly about all the subpages cause on the top left hand corner its all label out and easy to spot, not too complicated.
